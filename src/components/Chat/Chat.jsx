                                    Then you should come here for your Christmas
                                    vacation. We have much snow and sometimes
                                    even terrible snowstorms. Kids have much fun
                                    making snowmen and playing snowballs. But I
                                    prefer to stay indoors in winter, I barely
                                    go out.
